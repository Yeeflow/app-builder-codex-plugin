# <Application Name> - Yeeflow App Plan

Use this template as Stage 2 / Step 2 for every Yeeflow application build. This plan must be created from the approved Functional Specification. Its purpose is to convert business requirements into Yeeflow-standard resources and define the correct resource generation order. Page-level function, content, layout intent, responsive behavior, and control-by-region detail belong in the Stage 3 Page Function Plan.

This document is the implementation contract for package generation after user approval. It must use only Yeeflow resource types, field types, variable types, controls, Dynamic controls, workflow nodes, form actions, Collection/Kanban actions, Sub List actions, property paths, bindings, and configuration shapes supported by the active `@yeeflow-app-builder` plugin knowledge base, skills, standards, validators, template library, control/property knowledge base, extension registry, or export-proven references.

## 2. Requirement-to-Yeeflow Resource Mapping Summary

Map each major requirement from the Functional Specification to Yeeflow resources.

| Requirement Area | Business Requirement | Yeeflow Resource Type | Planned Resource Name | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Data management | <Requirement> | Data list or Document library | <Name> | Yes/No | Select one exact Yeeflow resource type |
| Approval/review | <Requirement> | Approval form | <Name> | Yes/No | <Notes> |
| Approval output | <Requirement> | Form report | <Name> | Yes/No | Must be based on a specific Approval form |
| List browsing | <Requirement> | Data List view | <Name> | Yes/No | Must belong to a specific Data list or Document library |
| Dashboard/workbench | <Requirement> | Dashboard page | <Name> | Yes/No | Page-level UI resource, not a Form report |
| Automation | <Requirement> | Data-list workflow / Schedule workflow / Form action | <Name> | Yes/No | <Notes> |
| AI | <Requirement> | AI Agent / Copilot / AI Assistant node | <Name> | Yes/No | <Notes> |

Rules:

- Every core business requirement must map to a Yeeflow resource, a supported configuration, or an explicitly deferred item.
- Functional Specification to App Plan traceability is executable with `scripts/validate-functional-spec-to-app-plan-traceability.mjs --spec <functional-spec.md> --plan <app-plan.md>`.
- App Plan to Page Function Plan traceability is executable with `scripts/validate-app-plan-page-function-traceability.mjs --app-plan <app-plan.json> --page-function-plan <page-function-plan.json>`.
- Form report is a standalone Yeeflow resource type created from a specific Approval form. Do not merge Form report planning with Dashboard page planning or Data List view planning.
- Do not include resources only to make the plan look complete. Every generated resource must serve a runtime purpose.
- Do not invent unsupported controls, Dynamic controls, field types, workflow node types, variable types, action shapes, property paths, bindings, or configuration shapes.

## 3. Resource Generation Order

Define the exact order in which resources must be generated.

| Order | Resource Type | Resource Name | Depends On | Reason for Order | Blocking If Missing |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Data list | <Parent/master list> | None | Lookup parent must exist first | Yes/No |
| 2 | Data list | <Child/transaction list> | <Parent list> | Needs lookup to parent | Yes/No |
| 3 | Approval form | <Form> | <Lists/fields> | Needs lookup/sublist/field bindings | Yes/No |

Standard order:

1. Data lists and Document libraries.
2. Approval forms and approval workflows.
3. Form reports based on their related Approval forms.
4. Schedule workflows.
5. AI Agents.
6. Copilots.
7. Custom Data List forms.
8. Data List workflows.
9. Notifications.
10. Data List views.
11. Dashboard pages.
12. Application navigation.
13. Target users, roles, groups, and permissions.

Rules:

- Parent/master data lists must be generated before child/transaction lists that depend on them.
- Lookup target lists and display fields must exist before dependent Lookup fields are generated.
- Approval forms that use list lookups, sublists, summaries, Query data, or Set data list actions must depend on those lists.
- Dashboards must depend on the lists, views, forms, actions, and variables they display or trigger.
- The Page Function Plan is not a generated Yeeflow resource. It is the required Stage 3 page-level contract before Application Design System, page design, page/resource generation, implementation blueprints, package generation, signing, install/import/upgrade, or runtime proof.

## 4. Data Lists and Document Libraries Plan

Repeat this subsection for each Data list or Document library.

### 4.x <List or Library Name>

- Selected Yeeflow resource type: Data list or Document library
- Package/navigation representation: Type `1` Data list / documented Document library representation / `export-learning-required`
- Description:
- Business purpose:
- Master/transaction/reference:
- Creation order:
- Depends on:
- Used by:
- Navigation visibility:
- Sample/reference data required: Yes/No

#### Fields

| Field Order | Business Label | Display Name | Internal ID / Field Key | Exact Yeeflow Field Type | Exact Yeeflow Control Type | Support Source | Proof Label | Fallback / Deferred Reason | Required | Unique | Default Value | Placeholder | Validation Rules | Choice Values | Lookup Target | Lookup Display Field | Additional Lookup Fields | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Contract title | Title | Title | Title | input control | plugin-known field/control type | validator-backed | N/A | Yes | No | | <Placeholder text> | | | | | | Native title field |

Field rules:

- Field types must follow active plugin Data List / Document Library field standards.
- Distinguish business-friendly labels from exact Yeeflow implementation types. `Business Label` may say `Owner/person`, but `Exact Yeeflow Field Type` must say the exact plugin-supported type such as `User`.
- Do not use slash-combined final implementation types such as `Title/Text`, `Currency/Number`, `User/person`, `Attachment/File upload`, `Document library / Data list`, or `Type 1/document library` unless the row is marked `export-learning-required`, `runtime-proof-required`, or `deferred` with a fallback/deferred reason.
- Document Library planning must select one clear Yeeflow resource type. If the package/navigation representation is not known, mark it `export-learning-required` or `runtime-proof-required` and do not treat the resource as generation-ready.
- Keep the native `Title` field unless the plugin standard explicitly allows otherwise.
- Choice fields must define runtime-visible choices using the supported schema.
- Lookup fields must identify target list, display field, and additional fields when needed.
- User/person fields must use supported User field shapes.
- Date fields must use supported Date/DateTime types.
- Currency/number fields must use supported numeric field types.
- Multiline notes, descriptions, and justifications must use supported multiline text fields.
- Barcode, serial number, asset tag, and external code values should use text unless a supported barcode-specific field is required.
- Placeholder text must be defined for user-entered fields when the exact selected field/control type supports placeholders. If placeholder support is unknown, mark the row `runtime-proof-required`, `export-learning-required`, or `deferred` with reason, fallback, and proof/generation impact.

#### List Relationships

| Related List | Relationship | Field | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| <List> | parent/child/reference | <Lookup field> | Yes/No | <Notes> |

#### Sample or Reference Rows

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| <Purpose> | <Values> | <Lookup rows> | Yes/No | <Notes> |

## 5. Approval Forms Plan

Repeat this subsection for each Approval form.

### 5.x <Approval Form Name>

Submission form rules:

- Variable and control types must follow active plugin Approval Form standards.
- Distinguish business labels from exact Yeeflow implementation types. Slash-combined or vague implementation wording is not generation-ready unless marked `runtime-proof-required`, `export-learning-required`, or `deferred`.
- Lookup fields must identify target list, display field, and additional fields.
- Sublist fields must define row fields, summary fields, and any summary-to-form-field bindings.
- Default values, dynamic display rules, read-only state, and validations must be explicit.
- Placeholder text must be planned for editable fields when the exact selected variable/control type supports placeholders. If support is unknown, mark the row `runtime-proof-required`, `export-learning-required`, or `deferred` with reason, fallback, and proof/generation impact.

#### Approval Workflow Nodes

| Step Order | Node Name | Node Type | Purpose | Assignee / Actor | Configuration | Branches | Branch Conditions | Data Read/Write | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

- Temp variables are frontend-only.
- Query data and Set data list actions must identify target application/list/fields.
- If a form includes a Sub List, explicitly state whether custom List actions are required.
- If custom Sub List actions are required, list each action and its steps.
- Supported list action types must come from plugin-known/export-proven Sub List action shapes, such as add item, duplicate item, delete item, import items, move up/down, insert before/after, or supported custom action patterns.
- `Exact Yeeflow List Action Type` must use a plugin-known/export-proven action type or be marked `export-learning-required`, `runtime-proof-required`, or `deferred`.
- Each Sub List action must state current row context.
- If Summary fields are used, identify which Summary fields are affected.
- If Summary is bound to parent form fields, state the binding.
- Runtime execution proof for Sub List actions is separate from package validation.
- If no custom List actions are required, explicitly write: `No custom Sub List actions required`.

## 6. Form Reports Plan

Normally, each Approval form should have a corresponding Form report.

| Form Report Name | Related Approval Form | Purpose | Includes Sublist | Fields Included | Extra Field Configuration | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| <Report> | <Approval form> | <Purpose> | Yes/No | <Fields> | <Config> | <Notes> |

Rules:

- If a report needs Sublist data, plan a report structure that supports Sublist display.
- If an Approval form does not need a Form report, state the reason.
- Form Reports are not required Page Function Plan UI design surfaces unless the App Plan explicitly requires a print-like UI surface outside the normal Form Report resource.

## 7. Schedule Workflows Plan

| Schedule Workflow Name | Description | Schedule Configuration | Trigger Frequency | Nodes | Branches | Data Read/Write | Proof Level | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

- If a custom Data List form includes a Sub List, explicitly state whether custom List actions are required.
- If custom Sub List actions are required, list each action and its steps, current row context, affected Summary fields, and parent field bindings.
- Supported list action types must come from plugin-known/export-proven Sub List action shapes, such as add item, duplicate item, delete item, import items, move up/down, insert before/after, or supported custom action patterns.
- Runtime execution proof for Sub List actions is separate from package validation.
- If no custom List actions are required, explicitly write: `No custom Sub List actions required`.

## 11. Data List Workflows Plan

Return to the Data lists and Document libraries from Section 4 and plan list workflows.

| Workflow Name | Host List/Library | Trigger Condition | Nodes in Order | Branches | Branch Conditions | Data Read/Write | Notifications/AI/External Calls | Proof Level | Notes |

- Business purpose:
- Navigation placement:
- Depends on:
- Temp variables required:
- Page/form actions required:
- pageFunctionPlanRef:
- dashboardFunctionRef:
- Runtime proof required:

Rules:

- Every Dashboard page declared in the App Plan must include `pageFunctionPlanRef`, `dashboardFunctionRef`, or an equivalent stable reference ID that points to the matching Stage 3 Page Function Plan entry.
- The App Plan declares that the Dashboard page exists as a Yeeflow resource, where it appears in navigation, which resources it depends on, and which high-level actions or temp variables are needed.
- The App Plan must not embed full Dashboard section/control/template details.
- Do not put Page Function Plan Dashboard implementation fields, concrete Dashboard template IDs, or golden reference IDs in the App Plan.
- Dashboard page implementation intent belongs in the Page Function Plan.
- When a Page Function Plan exists, downstream Dashboard generation must consume the Page Function Plan entry and must not infer sections only from the App Plan resource list.

## 15. Application Navigation Plan

| Navigation Order | Group | Item | Yeeflow Resource Type | Target Resource | Visible | Icon | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

Runtime navigation rules:

- Groups use `Type: "classes"` with `list`.
- Dashboards/pages use `Type: 103`.
- Approval forms use `Type: 105` with `ListID = Forms[].Key`.
- Data lists use `Type: 1`.
- Do not use runtime group `children` or `Childs`.
- Every intended resource must be reachable through navigation or explicitly hidden/deferred.

## 15A. Page Function Plan Traceability References

Use this section to reference the Stage 3 Page Function Plan without embedding all page details in the App Plan.

| App Plan Resource Type | App Plan Resource Name | Surface / Form Name | Source List or Library | Fields / Actions Referenced | pageFunctionPlanRef / dashboardFunctionRef | Required Before Generation | Notes |

| Data list / Document library | <List/library name> | <New/Edit/View/Detail/Custom form> | <List/library name> | <fields/actions> | PFP-<ID> / Section <x> | Yes when planned | <Notes> |

Rules:

- The App Plan defines which dashboard pages, approval forms, custom data list/document library forms, resources, fields, workflows, views, navigation, roles, and permissions exist.
- The Page Function Plan defines page-level function, content, controls, data source, fields, actions, layout intent, mobile behavior, and App Plan traceability.
- Every Dashboard page in the App Plan must include `pageFunctionPlanRef`, `dashboardFunctionRef`, or an equivalent stable Page Function Plan reference ID.
- The App Plan must not embed Dashboard golden-reference selection, Dashboard section template IDs, or full Dashboard section/control detail.
- Page Function Plan entries must reference App Plan resources by stable names: dashboard page name, approval form name, submission/task/print form name, data list or document library name, form name, source list/library, field names, actions, and workflow/form action references.
- Form Reports are not required as Page Function Plan UI design surfaces.

## 16. Target Users, Roles, Groups, and Permissions

| Role | User Group | Resource/Page/Form | View | Create | Edit | Delete/Archive | Approve | Admin | Notes |

## 17. Plugin Capability and Standards Compliance

| Capability Area | Plugin Knowledge Source | Supported Shapes Used | Unsupported/Unproven Items | Validator/Check | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Data list fields | <Skill/doc/reference> | <Types> | <Items> | <Validator> | <Notes> |
| Approval variables/forms | <Skill/doc/reference> | <Types> | <Items> | <Validator> | <Notes> |
| Workflow nodes | <Skill/doc/reference> | <Nodes> | <Items> | <Validator> | <Notes> |
| Dashboard controls | <Skill/doc/template> | <Controls> | <Items> | <Validator> | <Notes> |

Rules:

- The App Plan must be based on plugin-supported capabilities.
- All App Plan resource types, field types, variable types, controls, Dynamic controls, workflow nodes, form actions, Collection/Kanban actions, Sub List actions, property paths, bindings, and configuration shapes must come from the active plugin's known skills, standards, validators, template library, control/property knowledge base, extension registry, or export-proven references.
- Business-friendly labels must be separate from exact implementation types. Use split columns such as `Business Label`, `Exact Yeeflow Field Type`, `Exact Yeeflow Variable Type`, `Exact Yeeflow Control Type`, `Exact Yeeflow Action Type`, `Support Source`, `Proof Label`, and `Fallback / Deferred Reason` where needed.
- Slash-combined or vague implementation wording such as `Title/Text`, `Currency/Number`, `User/person`, `Attachment/File upload`, `Document library / Data list`, `Type 1/document library`, `Lookup/read-only dynamic field`, `Document/list section`, `Open detail/slide panel where supported`, or `Update row/status where supported` is not generation-ready unless marked `runtime-proof-required`, `export-learning-required`, or `deferred`.
- If a requirement depends on an unknown capability, mark it as export-learning-required, runtime-proof-required, or deferred.
- Do not plan invented control shapes, Dynamic control types, field types, variable types, workflow nodes, action schemas, property paths, bindings, or configuration shapes.
- Unknown shapes must be marked `export-learning-required`, `runtime-proof-required`, or `deferred` and must not be treated as generation-ready.

| Dashboard grid-table Collection gate | If planned | Header + Collection wrapper and detail links valid | Signing/install |
| Root padding gate | For dashboards/custom forms | Token-array root padding valid | Signing/install |
| Plan-to-package conformance | Yes | Planned resources implemented or explicitly deferred | Handoff |
| Advanced capability gate | If planned | AI Agents, Copilots, custom code, custom CSS, integrations, notifications, schedule workflows, and external execution are plugin-supported, export-proven, runtime-proof-required, or deferred | Generation/handoff |

- Business decision gates answered/user-default-approved-for-generation or no blockers: Yes/No

### Advanced Capability Gate

- AI Agents, Copilots, custom code, custom CSS, integrations, notifications, schedule workflows, external calls, advanced controls, Dynamic controls, Collection/Kanban actions, Sub List actions, property paths, bindings, and configuration shapes must cite plugin-known skills, standards, validators, template library entries, control/property knowledge base entries, extension registry entries, or export-proven references before generation.
- Unknown or partially proven advanced capabilities must be marked `export-learning-required`, `runtime-proof-required`, or `deferred`.
- Do not invent unsupported control, resource, action, workflow-node, schedule, AI, Copilot, custom-code, notification, integration, property, binding, or configuration shapes.
- Runtime execution proof for AI, notifications, schedule workflows, external integrations, custom code, and permission enforcement is separate from package generation, signing, install/import/upgrade acceptance, and browser render proof.

## 19. Validation Plan

| Validation Layer | Scope | Tool/Method | Expected Result | Proof Boundary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| App-plan conformance | Resources vs plan | <Validator/manual> | pass/fail | Local proof |
| Business clarification | Decision gates | `validate-business-clarification-gate.mjs` | pass/fail | Planning readiness only |
| Generation readiness | 13 resource areas and review gates | `validate-generation-readiness-review.mjs` | pass/fail | Planning readiness only |
| Functional Spec to App Plan traceability | Requirement categories vs planned resources | `validate-functional-spec-to-app-plan-traceability.mjs` | pass/fail | Planning traceability only |
| App Plan to Page Function Plan traceability | UI surfaces vs page function entries | `validate-app-plan-page-function-traceability.mjs` | pass/fail | Page planning traceability only |
| Page Function Plan structure | Page function entries, controls, fields, actions, responsive behavior | `validate-page-function-plan.mjs` | pass/fail | Page planning readiness only |
| Package schema | `.yapk`/`.yap` schema | <Validator> | pass/fail | Local proof |
| Control/property fidelity | Controls and bindings | <Validator> | pass/fail | Local proof |
| Runtime UI | Browser load/screenshots | <Runtime test> | pass/fail | Runtime proof |
| Workflow execution | Workflow test | <Runtime/manual> | pass/fail | Execution proof |

Include:

- Data-list/schema validation:
- Approval-form validation:
- Form report validation:
- Schedule workflow validation:
- AI Agent/Copilot validation:
- Custom data list form validation:
- Data list workflow validation:
- Notification validation:
- View validation:
- Dashboard/control validation:
- Navigation validation:
- Permission validation:
- Signing validation:
- Upgrade-check/upgrade-apply validation:
- Runtime verification:

Report wording requirement:

- Functional Specification structure: pass/fail
- App Plan resource order: pass/fail
- Functional Spec to App Plan traceability: pass/fail
- Page Function Plan structure: pass/fail
- App Plan to Page Function Plan traceability: pass/fail
- Generation Readiness structural check: pass/fail
- Business Clarification Gate for planning: pass/fail
- Business Clarification Gate for generation: pass/fail
- Overall generation readiness: pass only if all required planning gates pass for generation

If Generation Readiness structural check passes but Business Clarification Gate for generation fails, write exactly: `Overall generation readiness: blocked by Business Clarification Gate`. Do not write only `Validation passed` or `all passed` when planning defaults are only applied for planning.

## 20. Proof Boundary

Separate these proof levels:

- Plan approval:
- Local generation validation:
- Package schema validation:
- ID provenance proof:
- Navigation runtime metadata proof:
- Dashboard/control proof:
- Signing proof:
- API install/import/upgrade acceptance:
- Runtime materialization/render proof:
- Workflow execution proof:
- Scheduled workflow execution proof:
- Notification delivery proof:
- AI Agent/Copilot execution proof:
- External integration execution proof:
- Permission enforcement proof:

Boundary rule:

- Signing/install/upgrade acceptance does not prove runtime UI fidelity, workflow execution, notification delivery, AI execution, permission enforcement, or external integration behavior.
- Business Clarification Gate, Generation Readiness Review, and Functional Spec to App Plan traceability prove planning readiness only. They must pass before full-page canonical design images, page implementation blueprints, resource generation, decoded resource-vs-blueprint parity, signing, install/import/upgrade, or runtime proof, but they do not prove generated package validity or runtime behavior.
- Page Function Plan validation and App Plan to Page Function Plan traceability prove page-planning readiness only. They must pass before Application Design System, full-page canonical design images, page implementation blueprints, page/resource generation, decoded resource-vs-blueprint parity, signing, install/import/upgrade, or runtime proof, but they do not prove generated package validity, visual fidelity, or runtime behavior.

## 21. Assumptions

- Business assumptions:
- Data assumptions:
- Role/user assumptions:
- UI/control assumptions:
- Workflow assumptions:
- Package/output assumptions:

## 22. Deferred or Runtime-Proof Items

| Item | Category | Reason | User Impact | Fallback | Required Proof or Follow-up |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| <Item> | deferred/runtime-proof-required/post-import-config | <Reason> | <Impact> | <Fallback> | <Proof/follow-up> |

Include:

- Anything not generated.
- Anything generated but not runtime-proven.
- Anything requiring browser/manual verification.
- Anything requiring tenant-specific users/groups/positions/configuration.
- Anything requiring custom code, custom CSS, scheduled execution, notification delivery, AI execution, or external integration proof.

## 23. Recommended Next Prompt

Use this prompt after the plan is approved:

`Use @yeeflow-app-builder to generate <Application Name> from <app plan path>, <page function plan path>, and <application design system path>. Treat the approved Functional Specification, App Plan, Page Function Plan, and Application Design System as the implementation contract. Generate the complete planned application unless an item is explicitly deferred. Use .yapk by default unless .yap is explicitly requested. Follow the resource generation order in the App Plan and the page-level function contract in the Page Function Plan. Use only plugin-supported Yeeflow resource types, field types, variable types, controls, Dynamic controls, workflow nodes, form actions, Collection/Kanban actions, Sub List actions, property paths, bindings, and configuration shapes. Validate schema, ID provenance, navigation runtime metadata, approval forms, form reports, schedule workflows, AI/Copilot resources, custom data list forms, Sub List actions, data-list workflows, notifications, views, Page Function Plan traceability, dashboard control selection, item-template Dynamic controls, Collection/Kanban actions, grid-table Collection patterns, root padding, graph, UI quality, app-plan conformance, package wrapper/signing readiness, and source/dist consistency. Do not run live Yeeflow API calls, write operations, install/import/upgrade, or runtime tests unless explicitly authorized. Report local validation, signing status, API acceptance, runtime proof, deferred items, and known risks separately.`
